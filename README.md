dotfiles
========

Contains all my dotfiles and many other pieces of configuration. Many have sections cribbed from various places.

This directory is managed with stow to make everything easier. Iff using zsh, running ./dotstow.sh from this directory - located in $HOME - will symlink everything in each folder to $HOME nice and tidily.
